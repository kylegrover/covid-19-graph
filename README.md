# Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard

ðŸ“ˆ [**Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard**](https://covid19graph.netlify.com/) shows the dynamics (the curvature of the graph) of Ð¡oronavirus distribution per country.

## Reasoning

The reason for creating a new dashboard was to complement the well-known [JHU Dashboard](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) (which is made by Johns Hopkins CSSE) with the feature of seeing the charts with the number of COVID-19 `confirmed` / `active` / `recovered`/ `deaths` use-cases per country.

Basically I personally had a question like: _"What about the Netherlands/Ukraine?"_, _"Is the virus spread (growth factor) slowing down?"_, _"How I can compare the recovered/deaths dynamics per-country?"_, _"Which countries are doing the proper things to slow down the growth-factor"_.

### Main Functionality

The dashboard is still raw but it provides a basic functionality of displaying the global and per-country data charts.

Here is how the main functionality looks:

## Data source and tech-stack

The dashboard is using [COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) as a data source.

Front-end wise I've tried to make it as simple as possible, therefore the dashboard is using a pure [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) (without `JSX` transpiler or `CreateReactApp` starter). To draw the chart I've used [Charts.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).

### Ideas / To Do:

- pull population data - https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/ (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2019). World Population Prospects 2019, Online Edition. Rev. 1.) 
    - alter country names to match CSSEGIS data
- list per capita of all numbers
- list daily change for all numbers
- filter by date
- filter by population
- projections
